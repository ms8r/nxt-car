Lego NXT Car
============

A little family project, using [nxt-python](http://code.google.com/p/nxt-python/) to build a Lego car that uses an accelerometer as a steering wheel type remote control.

We're still waiting for the accelerometer to arrive. So far we're just usingtouch sensors to control steering, and ultrasound to reverse direction.
